a. we think that it would take about 2 minutes for article if we wanted to 
do it manualy.
b. this code can be useful in other ways.
with similar idea we can solve anything that requires finding
number of appearances in many web pages, like how many time someone
appeared in different clases in different years.
c. in order to check every hour you would have to run the code every 
hour. you can do it automaticly if you use the watch command, but
instead of creating a new list of links every time you will diff the
new (orginized) list with the old one, and search only in the new articles.
